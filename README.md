# Create DIN 5008 letters using Markdown

This template is an improvement of [Phoenix4815/pandoc_letter](https://github.com/Phoenix4815/pandoc_letter), with a couple of ideas from [selfawaresoup/latex-templates](https://github.com/selfawaresoup/latex-templates).

It does unterstand additional settings `invoice` and `frombank` now, to be able to write invoices.
